# hybrid-zfs-root-unlock
Unlock ZFS native encryption on root pool using key stored in LUKS as a work-around for zfs not supporting all the things luks supports.  

This is part of my scheme for getting native zfs encryption with all the unlock options of LUKS on my laptop (tpm, tang server, yubikey, etc.).

TODO - Link to howto for setting this up when it is written.
